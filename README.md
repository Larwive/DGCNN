# DGCNN
A fork of the DGCNN repository by xueyunlong12589.
This fork attempts to add the missing code to reproduce (partially) the learning described in the paper.

Link to the paper : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8320798

This was used originally for the DREAMER dataset.
You can request access to the dataset here : https://zenodo.org/records/546113

Just run `read_dataset` from `DREAMER_extract.py` once and then run `main.py` to train the model.


Original README:
Repetition code of the model for the paper "EEG Emotion Recognition Using Dynamical Graph Convolutional Neural Networks" in pytorch


Now the paper's authors have open-source the code(http://aip.seu.edu.cn/songtengfei)
